The basic idea:

 - fetch toshl csv
 - toggl.js script to fetch toggl data via api
 - create dataset for regression
 - run regression
 - script that does all this periodically
 - send email report every week


# Running it

To use this you will need
- node.js
- mongodb
- haskell
- a Toshl account
- a Toggl account
- a sendgrid account

Put everything into a directory. Fill in your sendgrid data in ./secrets.js, then fill out your Toggl and Toshl data in ./fetching/secrets.js

After that you just need to set up a cronjob to run ./runner.js every X days (I think 3 days is a good choice)
